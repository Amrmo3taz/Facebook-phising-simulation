# Facebook Phishing Page Simulation (Using SET on Kali Linux)

## Overview
This project demonstrates how phishing attacks work using the Social-Engineer Toolkit (SET) on Kali Linux.
It is created **strictly for educational and ethical hacking training purposes**.

## Tools Used
- Kali Linux
- Social-Engineer Toolkit (SET)
- Apache Server (for hosting the phishing page)

## Objective
To clone the Facebook login page and collect test credentials to simulate a phishing attack and understand user-level vulnerabilities.

## Steps Followed

1. Opened SET on Kali:
    ```bash
    sudo setoolkit
    ```

2. Navigated through the following options:
    - 1) Social-Engineering Attacks
    - 2) Website Attack Vectors
    - 3) Credential Harvester Attack Method
    - 2) Site Cloner

3. Entered cloning target:
    ```
    https://www.facebook.com
    ```

4. Hosted the phishing page locally using Apache.
5. Captured test credentials from the cloned page.

## Educational Purpose
- This project helps raise awareness of social engineering threats.
- Never use these techniques on real users or systems without authorization.
